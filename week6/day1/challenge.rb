# Create a method that will generate a heroku-like URL.
#  - ALL urls should be unique (within reason)
#  - adjective-compound-noun-eight_digits_of_numbers
#  - URL MUST BE VALID
#
#  Bonus:
#    - Make the script use ARGV so the user can supply a name, use that instead
#    - If the user supplies more than 1 argument, use all of them to generate a random 2 word mashup
#    - Research using ARGV in Ruby (Remember ARGV is an array)
